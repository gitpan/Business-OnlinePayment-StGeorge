This is Business::OnlinePayment::StGeorge, an Business::OnlinePayment
backend module for the St.George Bank Internet Payment Gateway.  It is only
useful if you have a merchant account with St.George Bank:
https://www.ipg.stgeorge.com.au/ and their "Perl API".

It is (rather distantly, at this point) based on
Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet written by Jason Kohles.

There are additional tests in t2/ that may be useful to you once you have
a merchant account and the digital certificate from St. George.

Please send patches as unified diffs (diff -u).

Business::OnlinePayment is a generic interface for processing payments through
online credit card processors, online check acceptance houses, etc.  (If you
like buzzwords, call it an "multiplatform ecommerce-enabling middleware
solution").
